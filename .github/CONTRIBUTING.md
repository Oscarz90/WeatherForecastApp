## How to contribute to Ruby on Rails

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/Oscarz90/WeatherForecastApp) (pending).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Oscarz90/WeatherForecastApp/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Oscarz90/WeatherForecastApp/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report template to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [Issue Template](https://github.com/Oscarz90/WeatherForecastApp/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
  

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting template](https://github.com/Oscarz90/WeatherForecastApp/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to weather forecast app](https://github.com/Oscarz90/WeatherForecastApp/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change [opening an issue](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-core) using the "enhancement" label and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the app emailing to `omsz90@live.com.mx`.
